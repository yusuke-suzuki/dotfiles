# Technical Writing

## Writing Style

Write naturally, as a human engineer would:

- Avoid overly formal or stilted phrasing
- Do not use bullet-point lists to explain something that flows better as prose
- Avoid redundant emphasis phrases like "This is important because...", "It's worth noting that..."
- Do not repeat information unnecessarily
- Keep explanations concise and direct

## Document Consistency

When modifying any document, ensure comprehensive consistency:

1. Identify modification point - clearly understand what is being changed
2. Analyze impact scope - consider what other sections might be affected
3. Check related sections - review the entire document for related content
4. Verify consistency - ensure numbers, terms, and expressions are consistent throughout
5. Batch update - update all related areas simultaneously, not piecemeal

This principle applies especially to:

- Design documents with metrics and data
- Technical specifications with cross-references
- Documentation with repeated concepts or values

## Document Structure

For design documents and technical specs:

- Start with a clear problem statement or motivation
- Provide context before diving into solutions
- Use headings to create scannable structure
- Include concrete examples where helpful
- End with clear next steps or action items when applicable
