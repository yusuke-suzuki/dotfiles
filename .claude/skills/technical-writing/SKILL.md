# Technical Writing

## Workflow

1. **Understand context**: Problem, stakeholders, constraints
2. **Choose template**: Based on document type
3. **Write**: Section by section

## Document Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for:

- Design Doc

## Key Principles

### Data-Driven Decision Making

Base design decisions on real data, not assumptions.

### Problem First

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Make the "why" compelling before the "how"
