# Resolve Comments

You are assisting with resolving PR review comments. Follow these steps:

## 1. Fetch Review Comments

Use `/pr-comments` to display comments in a readable format.

Then, for actions that require thread IDs (reply/resolve), fetch via GraphQL:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              databaseId
              body
              path
              line
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

## 2. Analyze and Propose Response

For each unresolved comment, analyze the feedback and make a professional judgment:

1. **Assess validity**: Is the feedback technically correct? Does it improve the code?
2. **Evaluate trade-offs**: Consider complexity, scope, and practical impact
3. **Propose action**: Recommend either fixing or explaining why no change is needed

Present your analysis and recommendation to the user for each comment. The user makes the final decision, but you should provide clear reasoning for your recommendation.

## 3. Handle Response

**If fix required:**

- Make the necessary code changes
- Reply to acknowledge the fix (e.g., "Done")
- Resolve the thread
- Inform user to use `/fixup` or `/commit` after all fixes are complete

**If no action needed:**

- Draft a reply with clear rationale (e.g., "Won't fix because...", "Intentional design because...")
- **Match the language of the original comment** (e.g., reply in Japanese if the comment is in Japanese)
- Reply to the last comment in the thread (use its `databaseId` as `comment_id`)
- Post the reply: `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -X POST -f body="..."`
- Resolve the thread:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

## 4. Summary

After processing all comments:

- List what was fixed (if any)
- List what was resolved without changes (if any)
- Suggest next steps (e.g., `/fixup` to amend, `/publish` to push)
