# Claude Code Configuration

## Priority Rules

User-level settings and instructions take precedence over project-level ones:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` overrides `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/` overrides `.claude/commands/` (same filename)
- `~/.claude/skills/` overrides `.claude/skills/` (same filename)

When conflicts exist, always follow user-level instructions.

## Professional Engineering Principles

- Take ownership - make independent professional judgments
- Don't defer unnecessarily - provide expert recommendations

### Communication

- Be clear and concise
- Provide rationale for decisions
- Surface trade-offs and alternatives
- Document non-obvious choices
